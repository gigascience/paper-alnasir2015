-- A script of SQL Queries for SQLite that convert the SRA
-- a into directed acyclic graph for 2D-visualisation

-- Some tricks are required in order to tie the graph together...
--
-- i) a psudo-node is created to represent each table in the SRA
-- i.e. study, experiment, sample, run, submission etc...
-- ii) pseudo-edges are created to join each table record to one
-- of these pseudo-nodes so as to create hubs in the graph.
--
-- It is possible to weight the edges so the pseudo-edges have
-- an edge weight of 0.5 and normal edges have an edge weight of 1.
--
-- It is probably a good idea to take a smaller proportion of this
-- data as it contains approximately 4,049,658 edges and 1,706,119 nodes!!
